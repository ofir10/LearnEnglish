# LearnEnglish - Language Learning Application

LearnEnglish is a language learning application developed in Java that aims to help users acquire vocabulary and improve their language proficiency. This project utilizes SQLite to store and manage word data, and it offers dynamic word categorization by difficulty to adapt in real-time to the user's language proficiency level. Whether you're learning English or any other language, you can customize the word data by editing the files under `app/src/main/res/raw`.

## Features

- **Quizzes**: The application provides quizzes to test your knowledge and reinforce what you've learned.
